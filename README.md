# RETAIL-INDUSTRY
Analyzing the fashion dataset
# INTRODUCTION
The analysis of the fashion retail dataset was my first masters assessment. Two datasets were given from a retail store that stocks female wear, the data was composed of various kinds of fabric types, and lengths, from assorted brands.The data consisted of so many values that can be used to predict the possible extension of a sector.
The fashion retail industry is a very sophisticated, constantly growing sector. The success of this sector is not only dependent on sales but also on customer acquisition and retention. This project harnessed the power of big data analytics and machine learning to extract meaningful insights by utilizing Python for data exploration and machine learning, HQL (Hive Query Language) for efficient data integration, and Power BI for visualization to revolutionize the organization's approach in decision-making.
# OBJECTIVES
•	To adequately preprocess and conduct EDA.

•	To transform the column in JSON format into individual string columns.

•	To consolidate and merge the two datasets.

•	To identify the brand known for its unique occasion wear (most versatile).

•	Determine the most frequently stocked brand in relation to brand ID.

•	To build a machine learning model capable of forecasting both product ratings and prices.

# SKILLS EXHIBITED
•	Expertise in Hadoop and the MapReduce environment

•	Creating Hive Query Language scripts

•	Executing data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing tasks using Python

•	Employing Power BI for visualizing data

This high frequency suggests that "Sangria" is not only popular but also versatile. it also indicate that it enjoys a significant market presence and customer preference. Customers might associate positive qualities or value with this brand. Businesses can invest in marketing campaigns or strategies to promote "Sangria" products further. On the other hand, the brand represented by "W" appears only 8 times, making it relatively rare. This could imply that "W" is a niche or specialized brand with a unique target audience.|

Brands with significantly higher average prices may target a more premium market segment, while those with lower averages may cater to budget-conscious consumers. The differences in average prices suggest a market segmentation strategy. Brands with diverse price points may be trying to appeal to a wide range of customers with varying preferences and budgets. This analysis can help the brands gain insights into price sensitivity within their customer base. Analyzing customer behavior related to different price ranges can help in optimizing pricing strategies.|

Products with a high number of ratings have likely attracted more customer attention and interaction. The  products with consistently high ratings, indicates a high level of customer satisfaction. Conversely, products with fewer ratings or lower average ratings may suggest areas where improvements are needed to enhance customer satisfaction. Data on the number of ratings can be used in predictive analytics models to forecast future product performance and identify potential trends.|
| MOST VERSATILE BRAND | ![image](https://github.com/Meenaht/RETAIL-INDUSTRY/assets/115886576/ea8875fa-7b6b-40b2-8270-182621b46110) | AHIKA Women Black & Green Printed Straight Kurta accounted for 14.83% of sum of rating count. This is the most rated and can also account for most bought with so many products in one brand. | 
 # CONCLUSION
 This data analysis project was conceived with the primary objective of unlocking the full potential embedded within the expansive retail fashion datasets. To achieve this, a strategic series of rigorous data processing techniques was employed,  which capitalized on the robust capabilities offered by Hive Query Language (HQL), conducted exhaustive exploratory data analysis (EDA) leveraging Python, and harnessed the dynamic capabilities of Power BI for the purpose of data visualization. All these efforts coalesced into a collective pursuit aimed at cultivating data-driven insights, a vital precursor to informed decision-making within the ever-evolving and vibrant landscape of the fashion industry.
